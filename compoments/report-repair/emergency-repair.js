        An emergency repair is when there&apos;s immediate danger to you or the
        structure of the building. In an emergency we&apos;ll make the situation
        safe; we may need to return another day to complete the full repair.
      </p>
      <p>
        All emergency repairs can be reported 24 hours a day, 7 days a week by
        calling <strong>0800 952 4444</strong> or <strong>020 7525 2600</strong>.
        You may experience longer waiting times due to a high volume of calls.
